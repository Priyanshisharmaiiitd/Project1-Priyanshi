# 📚 Library Management System – C++ (OOP Based)

This is a console-based Library Management System developed in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. The project allows basic operations like adding, searching, displaying, and deleting both books and users. File handling is used for data persistence, so data is retained even after the program exits.
